# Box Sorting System

This project uses TIA Portal and Factory IO to sort boxes by size (Large or Small) using sensors. The sorted boxes are directed to the appropriate conveyor line, counted, and displayed on a digital screen in the electrical panel.

## Components

- **Sensors**: Detect box size.
- **Conveyors**: Transfer boxes to the correct line.
- **Counters**: Track the number of boxes.
- **Digital Display**: Shows the count in the panel.

## Workflow

1. **Detection**: Sensors identify box size.
2. **Sorting**: Boxes are directed to the correct line.
3. **Counting**: Counts are displayed in real-time.

## Usage

1. Load the project in TIA Portal and Factory IO.
2. Start the simulation.
3. Monitor sorting and count display.
